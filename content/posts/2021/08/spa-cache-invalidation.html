    If you've ever set up a single-page application (e.g. one using Angular, React or another framework)
    to be served from Amazon CloudFront and S3, you have probably come across
    <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Invalidation.html"
       target="_blank">
        this page</a>
    about invalidations in Amazon's documentation. One of the key takeaways from the doc is that you should version the
    file names of your assets instead of invalidating CloudFront's cache every time you upload files (i.e.
    deploy your application) to S3. Specifically, you should create new files when content changes instead
    of overwriting the files that are already in your S3 bucket. This guidance makes sense because new files
    will be added to the cache automatically and users won't have to wait for old files to expire. For example,
    if I improve the quality of an image on my site, the user should only have to refresh the page to view it.
</p>
<p>
    For the purpose of this article, I will consider what this looks like for Angular applications, but the same
    concepts should apply for other frameworks and build tools such as Webpack. If we look at the output of
    Angular builds set to "production" mode, we can see that <i>almost</i> all of our files
    conveniently get a unique hash in the file name, which is in line with the guidance from above.
    <br>
    <br>
    dist/
    <br>
    |-- index.html
    <br>
    |-- main-es2015.41269647ae8f5df33279.js
    <br>
    |-- polyfills-es2015.757c8e8d9412b987e8ca.js
    <br>
    |-- primeicons.c55d94a248721abbd220.svg
    <br>
    |-- etc...
    <br>
    <br>
    You'll also notice that our index file still has the same name of "index.html".
    This is because index.html is <i>usually</i> the default homepage that web servers look for when
    serving an application. In the case of CloudFront, this is called the "Default Root Object". As with most
    web servers, you can set this to any file that you want, but using index.html is the most common for lots
    of reasons that are out of the scope of this article.
</p>
<p>
    Assuming that our build output will consist of an index.html file and several files with hashed names every time
    we deploy the application, the next logical step would be to copy all of these files to our S3 bucket.
    What will happen is that all the new files (e.g. everything except for the updated index.html) will be delivered
    to the cache. Unfortunately, the old index.html file will continue to exist in the cache. This means that users will
    not see our changes, because they will receive the stale index.html file that references the old JavaScript,
    CSS, images, etc...
</p>
<p>
    There are a lot of useful workarounds for this that others have posted or asked about online. Here are a few of
    them:
<ol type="1">
    <li><b>Serve your index.html file from another AWS service, such as Lambda or EC2, or parameterize the links
        to be loaded dynamically from a separate backend</b></li>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>I believe this is the approach that AWS refers to in the
            <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/UpdatingExistingObjects.html#ReplacingObjects"
               target="_blank">
                documentation</a>, when stating that you should "update the links in your web application
            or website to point to image_2.jpg". While this makes sense, this adds more services (and therefore
            more complexity) to our infrastructure and deployments. Ideally, we should be able to host and update
            our SPAs entirely via CloudFront and S3 to limit management overhead.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li><b>Configure CloudFront to never cache the index.html file</b></li>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>While this would work, I feel that it defeats the purpose of using a CDN. Why would we use a CDN if the
            edge servers don't cache the index.html file at all? This would also add latency to our site, because the
            browser will always be waiting for the index.html file to be returned from the S3 bucket instead of the
            user's local cache or the CDN.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li><b>Version the index.html filename (e.g. index_1.html, index_2.html) and update the Default Root Object
        in CloudFront with every deploy</b>
    </li>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Unfortunately, updating the Default Root Object requires a re-deploy of the CloudFront distribution.
            Although AWS has made improvements to this process, CloudFront distribution deployments are usually
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/slashing-cloudfront-change-propagation-times-in-2020-recent-changes-and-looking-forward/"
               target="_blank">five minutes or more</a>
            and don't solve our problem of getting new content to users quickly.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li><b>Invalidate the cache with every deploy</b></li>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>When we version all other assets besides our Default Root Object, this means we should only have to
            invalidate
            this one file (index.html) with every deploy. The downside to this, which is mentioned frequently in the AWS
            docs,
            is that invalidations are not free. They are however covered up to a limit under AWS's Free Tier,
            meaning that most individuals and small to medium organizations shouldn't see much cost as a result of this
            specifically.
            In practice, one should still use a wildcard ("/*") for the path when invalidating files, as it
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/simplified-multiple-object-invalidation-for-amazon-cloudfront/"
               target="_blank">simplifies implementation and can reduce cost</a>.
            When compared to the other options, I find this to be the best experience for updating SPAs that are served
            with CloudFront and S3.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the use case, any of the four above options (or one not mentioned here), could be the best choice
    for pushing out SPA updates to users quickly. I believe that in most scenarios however, invalidating the root object
    in the cache is the way to go. This can be done with the AWS CLI as part of an automated build process and is
    how the build for this blog works. As always, I can be reached via email at <b>fearer.jon.blog@gmail.com</b>
    with any feedback or questions on this post. Thanks for reading! I look forward to adding more content in
    the future.
