<p>
    Welcome to my personal blog! Blogging on various software topics is something
    that I've wanted to do for a while, but I've always preferred the freedom (and
    nostalgia) of personal blogs over the large platforms out there. As a result,
    this is my foray into that world.

<p>
    My posts on here will mostly be related to programming as well as cloud and data & analytics.
    I do not plan to add a comments section to this site directly, but if you have any feedback (constructive
    or otherwise), then feel free to email me at <b>fearer.jon.blog@gmail.com</b>. I may also repost
    future articles to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, where there is good comment
    and voting functionality.

    As for the website itself, it was built using <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 12</a> and
    <a href="https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/">PrimeNG</a>. It is hosted on AWS via a combination of
    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/">S3</a> and
    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">CloudFront</a>. The source code for this site is openly available
    on <a href="https://github.com/jon-fearer/blog">GitHub</a>,
    so feel free to take a look (or even fork it) for yourself. I plan to add Terraform for the infrastructure piece soon.
</p>
<p>
    Thanks again for visiting! I look forward to improving the site and posting more here in the future.
