    As part of my work building OrthoFi's integrations and data platform,
    a colleague and I were asked to write a
    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/how-orthofi-delivers-better-insights-for-customers-with-amazon-redshift-and-aws-glue/">blog post</a>
    about it for AWS. Check it out and let me know what you think. I can be reached
    via email at <b>fearer.jon.blog@gmail.com</b> or feel free to comment directly
    on the AWS blog post.
